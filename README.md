### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Rostam Satarzai

I am currently a 2nd Year Computer Science student at Queen Mary University Of London.

I have brief experience with Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript & PHP. I am looking to develop my programming skills by working on more projects which I will be uploading on this platform.
