### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Rostam, a Product Owner at Sky with a background in Computer Science from Queen Mary University of London. I bring a blend of technical understanding and product thinking, shaped by hands-on experience working with software engineers and UX teams to deliver impactful digital solutions.

My journey spans:
- Agile product development using SAFe 6.0
- Collaborating with cross-functional squads on Smart Home and sales journey features
- Translating complex requirements into dev-ready user stories
- Driving backlog refinement and sprint delivery with tools like Jira, Confluence, and Miro

Feel free to explore my projects and contributions, Iâ€™m always keen to learn, build, and improve.
